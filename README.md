# CareerCompass

CareerCompass is a single-role job-hunting platform designed exclusively for job seekers. By integrating with third-party job-listing APIs (e.g., Adzuna, USAJOBS, or other publicly available data sources), CareerCompass aggregates real-time job postings into one easy-to-use dashboard. This enables users to search, filter, and save relevant opportunities without having to manage multiple job board accounts or profiles.
